# Project Overview

This is a turn-based Battleship game played in the terminal and developed using Python's object-oriented programming (OOP). It involved creating a grid-based game where players take turns to guess the locations of each other's ships, demonstrating foundational skills in Python and OOP principles.

This project was created in fulfillment of the requirements for the course CMSC 12: Foundations of Computer Science under the Institute of Computer Science in the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os back in December 2018.
